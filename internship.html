 <p><b>Internship Experience</b></p>
 <p>Interning as the Career Services Graphic Designer has been one of the most important experiences I've had during my time at college. I have both learned and grown so much, and seeing the progression of my work and confidence makes me proud.</p>

  <p><b>Flyers</b></p>
  <p>I make a lot of flyers for events that are both digital and printed. I was able to make a template that works well but sometimes the event has a special design if it usus a specific graphic.</p>

  <div class="Ctext">
  <p><b>Digital Displays</b></p>
  <p>The digital displays I make also use a template that I created because of how many I have to make. It saves me a lot of time to be able to plug in the info and pictures that I format quickly. These are displayed on screens around the ISU campus, a lot of them are in the Bone Student Center.</p>

<!--Social Media-->

  <div class="Ctext">
  <p><b>Social Media</b></p>
  <p>These are some of the Instagram posts that I created. The ones shown are actually an old template that I had been using for awhile, but I was running into a problem where the names of the events were so long that the words would cover the faces in the image if I didn't move them, which is a big no no. I have since created a new template that I animated in After Effects, but I'm unable to upload gifs at the moment so they aren't shown.</p>
